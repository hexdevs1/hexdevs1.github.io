Here&rsquo;s how to build one that actually looks good on a phone.\nWhy YAML mode?

Use state_color: true everywhere Makes entities light up in their actual color when on. Much easier to scan.\n2. Conditional cards for alerts Only show a card when something needs attention:\n- type: conditional conditions: - condition: state entity: binary_sensor.front_door state: &#34;on&#34; card: type: markdown content: &#34;\ud83d\udeaa **Front door is open!**&#34; 3. Custom button sizes Wrap buttons in a grid card for consistent sizing:\n- type: grid columns: 3 square: true cards: - type: button entity: light.kitchen name: Kitchen tap_action: action: toggle - type: button entity: light.bathroom name: Bath tap_action: action: toggle 4. Separate mobile and tablet dashboards Don&rsquo;t try to make one dashboard work for both. Create two:\n# configuration.yaml lovelace: mode: yaml dashboards: tablet: mode: yaml filename: tablet_dashboard.yaml title: Tablet show_in_sidebar: true The result A clean, fast-loading dashboard with:\nWeather and quick stats on the home view Organized room-by-room light control Climate and security on dedicated views No scrolling through 50 cards to find the kitchen light Start simple.
